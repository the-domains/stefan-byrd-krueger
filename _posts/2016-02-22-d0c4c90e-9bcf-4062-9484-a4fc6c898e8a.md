Stefan Byrd-Krueger's journey to professional nirvana began with his passion for the arts as a sculptural welder, developed through his university training in policy analysis and years of experience in grassroots education and advocacy among think tanks, then blossomed as he took his love of elegant design and organizational excellence into the private sector as a digital marketing consultant. This blend of creative process, recognition of the human element of organizational success, and love of the technical discipline defines his working style.

Stefan is a data evangelist, specialized in analytics and the uniquely complex needs of the non-profit sector. His career has centered around the use of technology in communications portfolios, including experience in programming, design, and digital strategy. He has played the role of client as well as the role of consultant, and works to close the gap between the two.
