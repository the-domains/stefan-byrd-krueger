description: 'Big screens with real-time traffic data have become ubiquitous in newsrooms. They illustrate how news organizations are becoming more and more interested in tracking audience behavior, as data-informed approaches to decision making previously associated with popular sites like BuzzFeed, Gawker, and The Huffington Post are increasingly central to editorial decision making at upmarket brands like The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, and Quartz.'

How are analytics different for non-profits and other "idea-based" sectors? A great discussion of 'editorial analytics' and how they require you to break the mould of out-of-the-box analytics offerings.
